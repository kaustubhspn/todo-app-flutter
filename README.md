## TODO App

Welcome to our TODO app, built using the Flutter framework, which is available as both a web and Android application. With an SQL database for persisting data and local notifications for due date and theme change alerts, this app offers a range of useful features to make task management more efficient and enjoyable.

The app boasts a user-friendly interface, complete with customisation options for adding tasks and two theme options - light and dark. Users can also sign up and log in to access their personal task list.

While the app is already functional, there is always room for improvement. We plan to add more widget and unit tests to ensure the app is running smoothly, complete the signup and login flow, and integrate with a FastAPI backend. Additionally, we aim to deploy the app on iOS in the near future.
